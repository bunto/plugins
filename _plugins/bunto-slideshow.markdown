  Bunto Slideshow is a plugin to help you create image slideshows on your
  Bunto / Octopress site.

  By slideshow, we mean those neat little JavaScript lightbox things.
  Instead of big images in your main content, you get a series of
  thumbnails. Click on one and it appears in a lightbox, and you can scroll
  left and right through the other items in the list.
